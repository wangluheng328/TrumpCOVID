# TrumpCOVID


President Trump's twitter has always been interesing, I can't find any other head of a country being this enthusiastic in communicating with the public through social media. Especially in a time like this, the Coronavirus seems to push him to express more than usual. Despite my personal political standing, I want to analyze the power of his unique way of communication, specifically upon the incident of COVID-19. I suggest that as the President of the US, what he says, writes, or posts ought to have certain linkage with the majority, or even causation. This project serves to see whether Trump's sentiment in tweets is associated with that of the general public. This project is political-neutral, or, doens't contain any political content. Please feel free to go on!
